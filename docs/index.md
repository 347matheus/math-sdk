## **Complex Games Made Easy**

The Stake-Engine-SDK is a comprehensive framework designed to simplify the creation, simulation, and optimization of slot games. Whether you're an independent developer or part of a dedicated studio, this SDK empowers you to bring your gaming vision to life with precision and efficiency. By leveraging the Carrot Remote Gaming Server (RGS), developers can seamlessly integrate their games on [Stake.com](https://stake.com), ensuring a smooth and scalable deployment process.

## **Frontend - SDK**

### **Why Use the frontend SDK?**

The frontend-sdk is a PixieJS/Svelte package used for developing web-based slot games. This package walks though how to utilize powerful tools such as Turborepo and Storybook to test and publish slot games. Sample slot games are provided which consume outputs provided by the math-sdk, though the repo is customizable and can be tailored to accommodate custom events for slot games covering all levels of complexity.


## **Math - SDK**

### **Why Use the Math SDK?**

Traditionally, developing slot games involves navigating complex mathematical models to balance payouts, hit rates, and player engagement. This process can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. The Carrot Math SDK eliminates these challenges by providing:

- **Predefined Frameworks**: Start with customizable templates or sample games to accelerate development.
- **Mathematical Precision**: Simulate and optimize win distributions using discrete outcome probabilities, ensuring strict control over game mechanics.
- **Seamless Integration**: Outputs are formatted to align with the Carrot RGS, enabling quick deployment to production environments.
- **Scalability**: Built-in multithreading and optimization tools allow for efficient handling of large-scale simulations.
