## **Complex Games Made Easy**

The Stake-Engine-SDK is a comprehensive framework designed to simplify the creation, simulation, and optimization of slot games. Whether you're an independent developer or part of a dedicated studio, this SDK empowers you to bring your gaming vision to life with precision and efficiency. By leveraging the Carrot Remote Gaming Server (RGS), developers can seamlessly integrate their games on [Stake.com](https://stake.com), ensuring a smooth and scalable deployment process.

### **What Does the SDK Offer?**

The SDK is divided into two key components:

1. **Math Framework**: A Python-based engine for defining game rules, simulating outcomes, and optimizing win distributions. It generates all necessary backend files, including configuration files, lookup tables, and simulation results.
   
2. **Frontend Framework**: A PixieJS/Svelte-based toolkit for creating visually engaging slot games. This component integrates seamlessly with the math engine's outputs, ensuring consistency between game logic and player experience.
