# Stake Engine Software Development Kit

## **Math - SDK**

### **Why Use the Math SDK?**

Traditionally, developing slot games involves navigating complex mathematical models to balance payouts, hit rates, and player engagement. This process can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. The Carrot Math SDK eliminates these challenges by providing:

- **Predefined Frameworks**: Start with customizable templates or sample games to accelerate development.
- **Mathematical Precision**: Simulate and optimize win distributions using discrete outcome probabilities, ensuring strict control over game mechanics.
- **Seamless Integration**: Outputs are formatted to align with the Carrot RGS, enabling quick deployment to production environments.
- **Scalability**: Built-in multithreading and optimization tools allow for efficient handling of large-scale simulations.

### **What Does the SDK Offer?**

The SDK is divided into two key components:

1. **Math Framework**: A Python-based engine for defining game rules, simulating outcomes, and optimizing win distributions. It generates all necessary backend files, including configuration files, lookup tables, and simulation results.
   
2. **Frontend Framework**: A PixieJS/Svelte-based toolkit for creating visually engaging slot games. This component integrates seamlessly with the math engine's outputs, ensuring consistency between game logic and player experience.

### **Who Is This For?**

The Carrot Math SDK is ideal for developers looking to:

- Create custom slot games with unique mechanics.
- Optimize game payouts and hit rates without relying on extensive manual calculations.
- Generate detailed simulation outputs for statistical analysis.
- Publish games on Stake.com with minimal friction.
