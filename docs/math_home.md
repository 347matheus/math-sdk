# Carrot Software Development Kit

**Welcome to the Carrot-SDK!**

<!-- *Your one stop shop for spectacular slots* -->


## Math Framework

This *math-sdk* is a Python-based framework for simulating discrete outcomes for slot games. This package is used for outputting all relevant game files required by the frontend and Carrot Remote Game Server (RGS). There is an optional optimization program which can be used to balance discrete outcome probabilities. 


### **What Does the SDK Offer?**

The SDK is divided into two key components:

1. **Math Framework**: A Python-based engine for defining game rules, simulating outcomes, and optimizing win distributions. It generates all necessary backend files, including configuration files, lookup tables, and simulation results.
   
2. **Frontend Framework**: A PixieJS/Svelte-based toolkit for creating visually engaging slot games. This component integrates seamlessly with the math engine's outputs, ensuring consistency between game logic and player experience.

### **Who Is This For?**

The Carrot Math SDK is ideal for developers looking to:

- Create custom slot games with unique mechanics.
- Optimize game payouts and hit rates without relying on extensive manual calculations.
- Generate detailed simulation outputs for statistical analysis.
- Publish games on Stake.com with minimal friction.
