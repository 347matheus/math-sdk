# Optimizing win distributions with iterative weighted sampling

A discussion of how the provided optimization algorithm operates can be viewed by [downloading this paper](../distribution_optimization.pdf).

The aforementioned algorithm is implemented in the Rust programming language, this program compiles down to a binary executable. If the program is being run for the first time, or if there are modifications made to the *main.rs* file, the binary should be rebuilt using:
```sh
cargo build --release
```
