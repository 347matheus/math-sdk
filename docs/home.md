# Carrot Software Development Kit

**Welcome to the Carrot-SDK!**

<!-- *Your one stop shop for spectacular slots* -->


## Math Framework

This *math-sdk* is a Python-based framework for simulating discrete outcomes for slot games. This package is used for outputting all relevant game files required by the frontend and Carrot Remote Game Server (RGS). There is an optional optimization program which can be used to balance discrete outcome probabilities. 


## Frontend Framework

The *frontend-sdk* is a PixieJS/Svelte package used for developing web-based slot games. This package walks though how to utilize powerful tools such as Turborepo and Storybook to test and publish slot games. Sample slot games are provided which consume outputs provided by the math engine. Though the repo is customizable and can be tailored to accommodate custom events for slot games covering all levels of complexity.
