Every tumle increments the gloabl multiplier by +1
The global multiplier is applied to the tumble win
After all tumbles have completed: multiply tumble win by multipliers on board 
(multipliers on board do not increment the gloabl mult)
If there is a multiplier symbol on the board, this is added to the gloabl multiplier before the final evaluation
