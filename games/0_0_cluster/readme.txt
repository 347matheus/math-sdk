Cluster-based win game
Clusters of 5 or more like-symbols are removed from the board, and symbols above on the reelstrip
fall to fill their place 

Basegame:
Standard tumbling game with Scatter and Wild symbols
Minimum of 4 Scatter symbols are required for freeSpin triggers

Freegame:
All board positions start with a 1x multiplier - for every winning cluster, the multiplier value at that position is doubled (up to 512x)
A minimum of 3 scatters are required for re-triggers


Notes:
Because of the seperation between basegame and freegame types - there is an additiional freespin entry check to check of the criteria requires a forced 
freespin condition. Otherwise, occurences of Scatter symbols tumbling onto the board during basegame criteria may occur.
